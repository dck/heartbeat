# Heartbeat

![](https://travis-ci.org/luchkonikita/heartbeat.svg?branch=master)

This is a simple utility that allows you to check web-pages specified in a sitemap.
The program concurrently requests all the pages and prints the report with status
codes of received responses. Might be useful as a simple testing tool to find broken webpages
by looking for 5xx responses.
